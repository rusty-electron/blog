<h2>syncing remote folders using rsync</h2>



<p>I used to manage this blog by logging in to the VPS and then running the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lb</code> script to make new posts and edit or delete old ones. It kind of got tedious and I was always thinking of switching to using rsync to synchronize remote folders like this blog folder. I finally got around, installed rsync and looked up the man page. I needed a way to use the private key for the remote login so I found this useful command that downloads the remote folder to my local machine:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>rsync <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'ssh -i ~/path/to/privatekey.pem'</span> <span class="nt">-avz</span> user@hostname:/remote/directory/ ~/local/directory/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once the remote folder is downloaded on my local machine, I make changes to the local copy of the blog and then upload the changes to the remote server using the command:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>rsync <span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="s1">'ssh -i ~/path/to/privatekey.pem'</span> <span class="nt">-avz</span> ~/local/directory/ user@hostname:/remote/directory/
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Apart from being convenient, It is also efficient as when synchronization occurs, rsync makes use of its delta-transfer algorithm that transmits only the changes made to the source files and thus, reduces the amount of data sent. Also, these commands are very long and I cannot imagine myself typing these commands again and again so I suggest using shell aliases.</p>
