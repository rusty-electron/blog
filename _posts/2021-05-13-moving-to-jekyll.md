This blog is now built using `jekyll`, I previously used `lb` that was very minimalist but required writing the content of the posts in `html`, I could have created a pipeline to convert markdown into html but why make it so complicated when `jekyll` allows me to mix html in markdown and vice-versa.

My experience with `liquid` and `kramdown` has been amazing. Later I may include `mathjax` into the mix in case I need to write something 'math-intensive'.
