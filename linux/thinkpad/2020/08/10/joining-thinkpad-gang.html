<p>Yes, I have fallen for the infamous thinkpad meme and bought one.</p>

<p>Initially, I had no thought of purchasing linux hardware as opposed to a general laptop but as I delved deeper into the dark alleys of linux chads, distrohopping addicts and vrms bots, I started feeling the need to get a dedicated linux machine (yah, I have another laptop but for now I don’t have the courage to go full blown “commando” and wipe the windows partition, also I don’t want any dual-booted abomination). I initially had the idea of buying a used thinkpad and then upgrading it but after reading the reviews of refurbished and renewed laptops along with the lack of thinkpad parts in India, I dumped that idea. After days of deliberate thought, I finally decided to buy a Thinkpad E14, yah I know the newer thinkpads are not as good as the old ones and I’m inviting another Intel ME proprietary blob but it is the only option to get a reliable and ready machine. The specs I ordered are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Processor: Intel Core i3-10110U (backdoor inside) - yah, it is low spec but i’m broke and it should be fine for a dev machine.</li>
  <li>RAM: 4GB DDR4 (will upgrade to 8GB soon but why only 1 slot, lenovo?)</li>
  <li>Video Card: Intel UHD Graphics (won’t install steam, i promise)</li>
  <li>Storage: 256GB SSD (I have boot time OCD)</li>
  <li>Other interesting specs: close shutter on webcam, fingerprint reader on power button &lt;no-comments&gt;</li>
  <li><em>imp</em> OS: DOS</li>
</ul>

<p>The laptop should arrive around late August so this blog will be maintained through that machine after that point onwards.</p>
