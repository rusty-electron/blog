Now I wanted to replicate the same on my new machine. I looked up articles on printing on the archwiki and found something about CUPS. I started reading but due to my social media induced short attention-span, couldn’t read more than five lines, promised to read later and proceeded to install the package using &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pacman&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to ignore the gui tools and to my surprise, the web interface for CUPS is more than enough. It makes it easy to find, add and manage printer and its configurations like color settings, default paper size, margins, etc. The important part of setting up a new printer is choosing a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.ppd&lt;/code&gt; file, CUPS comes packaged with a lot of &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.ppd&lt;/code&gt; files for working with generic printers. It did not have the file for my printer though so after reading the troubleshooting section I came to know that I needed to install the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;hplip&lt;/code&gt; package from the AUR. Once I did that, the printer began to accept printjobs from my laptop. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For printing, open a file, if it has a full-fledged GUI click on the ‘print’ option or else ubiquitous shortcuts like ‘Ctrl+P’ work even on minimalist programs like ‘zathura’. The print dialog box in linux has most of the required options. For my config, the ‘preview’ button probably wasn’t set up and it printed the file instead. &lt;em&gt;TODO: find a fix for it&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CUPS is well-suited for commandline printing. The command given below should fulfill most of your needs. If it doesn’t, I’ll try to add more commands for common use-cases. &lt;em&gt;TODO: add more commands&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;lp &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-d&lt;/span&gt; printername &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; landscape &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; fit-to-page &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;media&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;A4 filename

It kind of got tedious and I was always thinking of switching to using rsync to synchronize remote folders like this blog folder. I finally got around, installed rsync and looked up the man page. I needed a way to use the private key for the remote login so I found this useful command that downloads the remote folder to my local machine:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rsync &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;ssh -i ~/path/to/privatekey.pem&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-avz&lt;/span&gt; user@hostname:/remote/directory/ ~/local/directory/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the remote folder is downloaded on my local machine, I make changes to the local copy of the blog and then upload the changes to the remote server using the command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;rsync &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-e&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&apos;ssh -i ~/path/to/privatekey.pem&apos;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-avz&lt;/span&gt; ~/local/directory/ user@hostname:/remote/directory/
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from being convenient, It is also efficient as when synchronization occurs, rsync makes use of its delta-transfer algorithm that transmits only the changes made to the source files and thus, reduces the amount of data sent. Also, these commands are very long and I cannot imagine myself typing these commands again and again so I suggest using shell aliases.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I used to manage this blog by logging in to the VPS and then running the lb script to make new posts and edit or delete old ones.

&lt;p&gt;Initially, I had no thought of purchasing linux hardware as opposed to a general laptop but as I delved deeper into the dark alleys of linux chads, distrohopping addicts and vrms bots, I started feeling the need to get a dedicated linux machine (yah, I have another laptop but for now I don’t have the courage to go full blown “commando” and wipe the windows partition, also I don’t want any dual-booted abomination). I initially had the idea of buying a used thinkpad and then upgrading it but after reading the reviews of refurbished and renewed laptops along with the lack of thinkpad parts in India, I dumped that idea. After days of deliberate thought, I finally decided to buy a Thinkpad E14, yah I know the newer thinkpads are not as good as the old ones and I’m inviting another Intel ME proprietary blob but it is the only option to get a reliable and ready machine. The specs I ordered are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Processor: Intel Core i3-10110U (backdoor inside) - yah, it is low spec but i’m broke and it should be fine for a dev machine.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RAM: 4GB DDR4 (will upgrade to 8GB soon but why only 1 slot, lenovo?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Video Card: Intel UHD Graphics (won’t install steam, i promise)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storage: 256GB SSD (I have boot time OCD)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Other interesting specs: close shutter on webcam, fingerprint reader on power button &amp;lt;no-comments&amp;gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;imp&lt;/em&gt; OS: DOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The laptop should arrive around late August so this blog will be maintained through that machine after that point onwards.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="linux" /><category term="thinkpad" /><summary type="html">Yes, I have fallen for the infamous thinkpad meme and bought one.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">syncthing - syncing over local wifi</title><link href="/2020/07/19/syncthing-syncing-over-local-wifi.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="syncthing - syncing over local wifi" /><published>2020-07-19T12:54:12+05:30</published><updated>2020-07-19T12:54:12+05:30</updated><id>/2020/07/19/syncthing-syncing-over-local-wifi</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/07/19/syncthing-syncing-over-local-wifi.html">&lt;p&gt;Sometime this year, I realized that manually managing a cloud folder in google drive/one drive is a time consuming process.

At one point I used WinSCP to edit the files in a GUI where it loads a local copy for editing and then copies the local edits to the server when I save it but I wanted a better solution for this, one where I don’t need to leave the CLI.

It’s more robust and responsive, especially over Wi-Fi, cellular, and long-distance links.”, it has made my life much easier and it is easy to catch on too. Another feature that I like is that in case when the internet connection is lost for longer periods, it doesn’t disconnect automatically and resumes when the connection is restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investing in Stock Market involves high risk but it does lead to high returns. Basically, in order to ensure you don’t lose your money you need to conduct good research on the company you wish to
invest in. Therefore, the investor has the ability to choose exactly which stock(s) he/she is going to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the area in which I’m mainly interested is Mutual Funds because it is less risky and I don’t want to lose the little money I have. The main component involved in mutual funds are the Asset Management Company or AMCs that invest our money in various stocks, bonds, sectors, etc. based on the advice and opinion of the fund manager/expert panel of the AMC. The AMCs earn money by taking a cut (which is mentioned beforehand) from the total profits received through the investment. Different mutual funds have variety in the rate of returns like from 4-30% and they have variety in risk too.  The area in which the AMC shall invest the money depends upon the type of the mutual fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: The return rates listed are always “expected” but not “guaranteed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main types of mutual funds are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Equity mutual funds - investments by AMCs are done on share market. Hence the risk and more reward. This category is again divided into five types.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Large/Small/Mid Cap equity funds - Some large cap equity have very high investment amount which results in low expected returns. For more details on how risk and return vary for different caps, see graphic.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Diversified or Multi-cap equity funds - the investment is done on stocks of companies that vary in cap sizes.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Equity Linked Saving Scheme - mainly for saving money on taxes&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Sector mutual fund - investment is done by the AMC on one sector only for instance, agriculture. Good investment if one sector is booming in particular.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Index Funds - this type of equity mutual fund is passively managed funds and the return is completely dependent on sensex/nifty.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debt mutual funds - investment on government bonds, certificates, etc. [write about bonds]. Its types are:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;liquid funds - very low risk and low but stable return rate&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;gilt funds - investment only in government bonds, very safe.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;fixed maturity plan - alternative to FD&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hybrid mutual funds - it is a mix of debt + equity funds. Based of the ratio of debt fund and equity fund investment. It is divided into two types:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Balanced Savings Fund (Equity savings) - 70% in debt and 30% in equity.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Balanced Advantage Fund (Hybrid aggressive) - 30% in debt and 70% in equity.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, mutual funds end up being a safer option because the investments undergo diversification i.e. the money is invested in various stocks (in accordance to expert opinion) so even if some of the stocks result in loss, it is possible to obtain the profit i.e. the return from the rest of the stocks. Also, through mutual funds it is possible to invest in stocks with very little savings because the AMCs make investments using the total amount collected and not through the investment by one individual.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I have been studying a little about share markets and mutual funds investment and in near future I plan to invest some extra cash so just for records I wanted to make some notes about the topic.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">web-scraping form field labels</title><link href="/2020/07/10/web-scraping-form-field-labels.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="web-scraping form field labels" /><published>2020-07-10T00:24:49+05:30</published><updated>2020-07-10T00:24:49+05:30</updated><id>/2020/07/10/web-scraping-form-field-labels</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2020/07/10/web-scraping-form-field-labels.html">&lt;p&gt;My cousin asked me to help with the documents required for a college form website so I checked the site but was too lazy to write it all down.

One way to solve this is to send null packets at regular intervals from the client side. Open the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;~/.ssh/config&lt;/code&gt; file and add the following lines:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Host example
    Hostname example.com
    Port 22
    User username
    ServerAliveInterval 240
    ServerAliveCountMax 2
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example&lt;/code&gt; with a label for the connection, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; with the hostname and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;username&lt;/code&gt; with the remote username. &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServerAliveInterval&lt;/code&gt; value of 240 means that it will send null packets every 240 seconds to keep the connection alive. According to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ServerAliveCountMax&lt;/code&gt;, the ssh client will close the connection if it does not receive a response after two tries. rtfm &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;man ssh_config&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">It is very annoying when I look up something in a different window and then switch back to the ssh terminal only to find out that the connection has timed out and I need to log in again.
